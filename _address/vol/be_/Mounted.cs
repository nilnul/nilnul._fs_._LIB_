When a mounted folder is created, users and applications can access the target volume either by using the path to the mounted folder or by using the volume's drive letter. For example, a user can create a mounted folder to associate drive D: with the C:\Mnt\DDrive folder on drive C. After creating the mounted folder, the user can use the "C:\Mnt\DDrive" path to access drive D: as if it were a folder on drive C:.*/
