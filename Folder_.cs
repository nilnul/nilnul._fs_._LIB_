Class and members to use
Standard Windows paths, such as Program Files, MyDocuments, the Desktop and so on
The System.Environment class is the most complete source for these, either through its static methods, such as SystemDirectory, or through the GetFolderPath method, using one of the Environment.SpecialFolder enumerated values.
Paths related to the current application
The Application class has static members to obtain certain paths, such as StartupPath, ExecutablePath, LocalUserAppDataPath, and CommonAppDataPath.

The GetTempPath method of the System.IO.Path returns the path of the temporary folder.

The GetCurrentDirectory method of the System.IO.Directory class returns the application's current executing directory.

The RootDirectory property of the DriveInfo class represents the specified drive's root directory.
Paths stored as application settings
Access the corresponding applications settings property of the wrapper class derived from ApplicationSettingsBase. For more information, see Application Settings for Windows Forms.
Registry storage
Some applications store directory information in the registry. The Application class has the CommonAppDataPath and LocalUserAppDataPath properties that resolve to a RegistryKey value.
ClickOnce applications
For ClickOnce applications, use Application class members such as UserAppDataPath, which will return a pointer to the ClickOnce data directory. For more information, see Accessing Local and Remote Data in ClickOnce Applications.
International applications
For international applications, retrieve the relative path portion from a string resource in your application by using the System.Resources.ResourceReader class. For more information about globalization and localization, see the topic Globalization and Localization.
