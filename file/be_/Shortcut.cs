	A more commonly used name for Windows symbolic link is shortcut. Shortcut is a much more advanced version of Unix soft link - in addition to the basic link-to-file relationship you can also set a description, an icon, and so on. In addition, shortcuts can point to non-file objects like printers. 

A shortcut is actually a file, usually with the .lnk extension (any other extension can also be registered as a shortcut). Like any other file it can be copied, renamed, or deleted; file operations on a shortcut don't affect the object being pointed to.
